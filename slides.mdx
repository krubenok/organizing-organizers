<Notes>
Beyond my courseload, I tack on a lot of extra curriculars. Like many of you probably, I find that activities outside of the classroom are more beneficial to my growth.
Because my schedule tended to get cramped pretty quickly, I decided it was important that I focused on being effective with my time with these groups to maximize my output while minimizing the time I spend working on them.
